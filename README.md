## Dependencies

## Sources

* The modified Red-Black Tree structure used to represent the beachline was based on an implementation be Emin Martinian that can be found [here](http://web.mit.edu/~emin/www.old/source_code/cpp_trees/index.html). It also draws substantially on the chapter on Red-Black Trees from [CLRS](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms).
