Algorithm:
    - New arcs only introduced on the beach line by point events, which are known in advance
    - Vertex events generated dynamically as algorithm runs when a parabola on beachline converges
        - Check each consecutive three arcs on the beachline.
            1) Compute the circumcircle
            2) Check if the 4th endpoint lies below the sweep line
            3) If it is, create a vertex event with y coordinate equal to that of the 4th point


    Point Events: Some new point p_i lies on L
        In o(logn), find out which arc currently defines the beachline at that location
